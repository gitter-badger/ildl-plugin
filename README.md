ildl-plugin
===========

This plugin enables data-centric metaprogramming, allowing library developers to implement domain-specific optimizations for their libraries. 
We used it in four sample transformations:
 * transforming the data representation
 * transforming collections of data
 * deforestation and retrofitting specialization
 * array of struct to struct of array transformations

If you're interested in:
 * trying it out, check out [the `Introduction` page of the wiki](https://github.com/miniboxing/ildl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial-|-Introduction);
 * understanding the theory, check out [this paper](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/207050?ln=en).

Thanks and enjoy!
