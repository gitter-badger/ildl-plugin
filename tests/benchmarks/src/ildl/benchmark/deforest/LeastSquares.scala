/**
 * The actual benchmark. The current benchmark is the linear regression,  a method for determining
 * the slope and offset of a straight line that best described a given set of points. This technique
 * is further explained at [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression]].
 *
 * Several factors influence the overall speedup. In the following diagram, we added
 * intermediate steps to the transformation, in order to isolate the individual factors
 * influencing the overall speedup.
 *
 * The diagram follows the transformation of the main data type in the program: the generic
 * List[T] container. The top part explains the transformation, the middle shows the updated
 * types and the bottom part shows the exact transformation description objects used for
 * the `adrt` scopes.
 *
 * We also added two manual transformations, which correspond to the programmer manually
 * rewriting the code in order to improve performance. While these can't be automated, they
 * provide important feedback for the other transformations and their expected performance:
 *
 *  {{{
 *          +--> this is the deforestation optimization: it takes the basic code that uses lists and
 *          |    optimizes it to use LazyList instead of List, thus delaying the execution of the map
 *          |    functions. Furthermore, since all results are delivered via sum, there is no need to
 *          |    create an actual list -- the results produced are just individual values. Avoiding the
 *          |    intermediate list creation produces significant speedups, mostly in terms of saving
 *          |    garbage collection cycles.
 *          |
 *          |                +--> this is the most we can optimize in this example in an automated fashion.
 *          |                |    Not only that we perform fusion, but we also specialize the generic
 *          |                |    computation using the miniboxing plugin. This shows three LDL-based passes
 *          |                |    over the code collaborating:
 *          |                |     - the ildl-plugin (with one LDL phase)
 *          |                |     - the miniboxing plugin (with one LDL phase for specialization and one
 *          |                |                              one for transforming FunctionX to MbFunctionX)
 *          |                |    As a curiosity, the Scala compiler has 25 phases, but when both the
 *          |                |    plugins are active, they add 21 extra phases, 15 for the miniboxing
 *          |                |    transformation and 6 for the ildl-plugin. Of course, including these
 *          |                |    plugins into the Scala compiler would reduce the phases a lot. :)
 *          |                |
 *          |                |                           +--> this is the manual counterpart of the
 *          |                |                           |    automated deforestation that we have seen
 *          |                |                           |    in the previous example. It reduces the
 *          |                |                           |    running time to some extent, as there is
 *          |                |                           |    still some abstraction in applying the
 *          |                |                           |    functions instead of doing the element
 *          |                |                           |    manipulation by hand. This example serves
 *          |                |                           |    to show the additional benefit coming from
 *          |                |                           |    inlining the functions

 *    | Least Squares Regression, original         |      8264 ms |    none |
 *    | Least Squares Regression, adrt generic     |       429 ms |   19.3x |

 *    +--------------------------------------------+--------------+---------+
 *
 * The numbers we obtained this time are significantly better than the ones reported in the paper.
 * We realized the difference when we implemented the manual traversal, which took only 195 ms. By
 * tracing back the difference, we realized we were triggering an unwarranted garbage collection run
 * exactly before executing the adrt scope, also counting that towards the execution time. Now, running
 * a garbage collection cycle in the setup phase, we do not incur any GC cycle for the miniboxed adrt
 * version (and the manual versions) and we only incur one GC cycle in the generic case.
 *
 * Note that, given an large enough heap (in this case, 8GB), the original benchmark runs in 700 ms,
 * instead of 8000ms. This corresponds only to the cost of traversing the arrays and allocating the
 * heap objects involved in the processing. However, on the HotSpot virtual machine, allocation is
 * highly optimized, so most of the overhead in the original benchmark comes from the garbage collection.
