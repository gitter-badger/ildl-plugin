/**
 * The actual benchmark. The current benchmark is finding the 10001-th Hamming number,
 * and the implementation is lifted directly from the Rosetta code website:
 *
 * [[http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hamming_numbers#Scala]]
 *
 * and adapted to improve performance.
 *
 * To obtain the speedup, there are several transformations taking place in parallel.
 * The following diagram shows what each transformation does and the exact transformation
 * object used with `adrt`:
 *
 *  {{{
 *                +--> this transformation is the one that brought the most benefit, since it achieved
 *                |    two results at once: being implemented as a fixed-size circular buffer queue
 *                |    and backed by a simple array, it improved locality and reduced access time.
 *                |    Furthermore, the Queue.enque method takes a variable number of arguments, which
 *                |    adds further overhead for packing and unpacking them. Using enqueue1, we used
 *                |    the fact that we only introduce one element at a time to our advantage: this
 *                |    way, we avoid the overhead associated to the variable number arguments.
 *                |
 *                |                +--> knowing the range is limited, we can reduce the size of the
 *                |                |    data by switching from the scala.BigInt object (backed by
 *                |                |    the java.math.BigInteger) to a smaller java.lang.Long. This
 *                |                |    saves some memory and some cycles when operating on the data,
 *                |                |    although there's not a lot of saving since both BigInt and
 *                |                |    java.lang.Long are heap-allocated objects.
 *                |                |
 *                |                |                     +--> unboxing: we switch from j.l.Long to
 *                |                |                     |              scala.Long and the backend
 *                |                |                     |              automatically unboxes it in
 *                |                |                     |              method signatures and the
 *                |                |                     |              underlying array used by the
 *                |                |                     |              FunnyQueue data structure.

 * These are the numbers we obtained:
 *
 *    +------------------------------------+--------------+---------+
 *    | Benchmark                          | Running Time | Speedup |
 *    +------------------------------------+--------------+---------|
 *    | 10001-th Hamming number, original  |      6.56 ms |    none |
 *    | 10001-th Hamming number, step1     |      2.70 ms |    2.4x |
 *    | 10001-th Hamming number, step2     |      2.16 ms |    3.0x |
 *    | 10001-th Hamming number, step3     |      1.64 ms |    4.0x |
 *    +------------------------------------+--------------+---------+
 *
 * We apologize for the fact that the numbers in the paper were more optimistic, indicating a speedup
 * of 8x -- this was a flaw in the benchmark that misled us. However, we have double-checked the
 * benchmark now and do not expect any further discrepancies.
